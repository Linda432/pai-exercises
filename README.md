# pai-exercises: AI Exercises in Python

These exercises have been prepared for a post-graduate taught
module in AI at NTNU in Ã…lesund.  Exercise provides a simulator
for a game or a puzzle.  The student's task is to implement an
intelligent agent playing the game.

This is work in progress and much of the code is rudimentary.
Feel free to suggest improvements.
